As a self-disciplined and hardworking student, I have gained hands-on experience with both NoSQL and SQL databases. Additionally, I had the opportunity to collaborate with my lecturer to implement organizational MVC architecture and REST APIs. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise and work ethic to make a positive impact and contribute to the success of the company. I am dedicated and committed to working hard and furthering the mission of the company. I am seeking a workplace where I can hone my skills, learn, contribute to the company, and grow as a professional.
